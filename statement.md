# Purpose of this blog

The idea behind this blog is to track my progress on learning new stuff. To learn is to grow.

The system I will follow is to work on **segments**. 

Every two weeks I will be focused on a single topic. I will write down notes on a newly dedicated blog entry for that segment. The title of each page should be the description of the topic for that segment. Besides that, there are no guidelines on how to chose a topic nor what to write about in the blog entry - that's up to me. 

Happy blogging!
