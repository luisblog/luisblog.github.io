# Purpose of this blog

The idea behind this blog is to track my progress on learning new stuff. To learn is to grow.

The system I will follow is to work on _segments_. Every two weeks I will be focused on a single topic and I will write down notes on a newly dedicated blog entry for that segment. There are no guidelines on how to chose a topic and what to write in the blog entry, that's up to me. The title of each page should be the description of the topic for that segment.
